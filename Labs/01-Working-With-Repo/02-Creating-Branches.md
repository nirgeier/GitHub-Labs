# Creating Branches Using GitHub GUI

- This guide explains how to create branches in a GitHub repository using the GitHub web interface (GUI). Branching allows you to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation from the main codebase.

## 3. Create a New Branch

- Create 2 branches: `bugfix-branch`, `feature-branch`.
- In the branch selector, type the name of your new branch
- GitHub will show an option: `Create branch: <your-branch-name>` from `<current-branch>`.
- Click this option to create and switch to the new branch.

---

## 4. Verify the New Branches

- The branch selector should now display your new branch name.
- Click on the `Branches` tab under the `Code` section to view all branches in the repository.
- Verify that your new branches (`bugfix-branch`, `feature-branch`) are listed.
