# Creating a GitHub Repository Using GitHub MCP

- This guide explains in detail how to create a new GitHub repository using the GitHub Copilot Model Context Protocol (MCP) extension installed in Visual Studio Code. 
- The MCP extension allows you to automate repository management tasks, including repository creation, directly from the VS Code interface using natural language prompts.


## Prerequisites

- `Visual Studio` Code installed on your computer
- The `GitHub Copilot MCP` extension installed in VS Code
- A `GitHub account` with permission to create repositories

### 01.01. Install (MCP Extension)

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac).
3. Search for `GitHub Copilot MCP` and click **Install**, or go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/mcp](https://code.visualstudio.com/mcp)
4. Verify the installation by checking if the extension appears in the list of installed extensions.
5. Verify the MCP server by opening `GitHub Copilot chat`, clicking on the settings icon, and ensuring the server status is "Running".

### 01.02. Authenticate with GitHub

1. After installation, you may be prompted to sign in to your GitHub account.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete authentication.

### 01.03. Open the Copilot Chat

    Make it public and add a README and a Python .gitignore
    Add policy to protect the 'main' branch
    ```

* You can customize the prompt to include details like description, visibility (public/private).license, and more. Here are some example prompts:
