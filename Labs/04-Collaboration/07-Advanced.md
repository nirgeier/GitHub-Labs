# Advanced Collaboration Features

- This guide covers advanced GitHub collaboration features including CODEOWNERS, automation, and integrations.
- You'll learn to implement sophisticated workflows for large teams and complex projects.

## 1. CODEOWNERS File

!!! tip "CODEOWNERS Benefits"

    CODEOWNERS provides automated code review assignment:

    - **Automatic Reviews**: Auto-assign reviewers based on file paths
    - **Expertise Routing**: Direct changes to subject matter experts
    - **Consistent Process**: Ensure proper review coverage
    - **Compliance**: Meet regulatory review requirements
    - **Team Scalability**: Distribute review workload effectively
    - **Quality Assurance**: Maintain code quality standards
    - **Knowledge Sharing**: Spread domain knowledge across teams

---

## 2. CODEOWNERS Configuration

### 2.1. File Location and Setup

Create `.github/CODEOWNERS` in your repository:

    # Global owners - applies to everything unless overridden
    * @organization/team-leads @senior-developer

    # Frontend code
    /src/frontend/ @organization/frontend-team
    /src/components/ @organization/ui-team
    *.css @organization/frontend-team
    *.scss @organization/frontend-team
    *.js @organization/frontend-team
    *.jsx @organization/frontend-team
    *.ts @organization/frontend-team
    *.tsx @organization/frontend-team

    # Backend code
    /src/backend/ @organization/backend-team
    /src/api/ @organization/api-team
    *.py @organization/backend-team
    *.java @organization/backend-team
    *.go @organization/backend-team

    # Database
    /migrations/ @organization/database-team
    /sql/ @organization/database-team
    *.sql @organization/database-team

    # Infrastructure and DevOps
    /.github/ @organization/devops-team
    /docker/ @organization/devops-team
    /k8s/ @organization/devops-team
    *.yml @organization/devops-team
    *.yaml @organization/devops-team
    Dockerfile @organization/devops-team

    # Documentation
    /docs/ @organization/documentation-team
    *.md @organization/documentation-team
    README* @organization/documentation-team

    # Configuration files
    package.json @organization/frontend-team @organization/devops-team
    requirements.txt @organization/backend-team
    Gemfile @organization/backend-team

    # Security sensitive files
    /security/ @organization/security-team
    /.github/workflows/ @organization/devops-team @organization/security-team

### 2.2. Pattern Matching Rules

**Path Patterns**

- `/path/`: Matches directory and subdirectories
- `*.ext`: Matches all files with extension
- `path/*.ext`: Matches files in specific directory
- `**/pattern`: Matches pattern anywhere in tree

**Priority Rules**

- Last matching pattern takes precedence
- More specific patterns override general ones
- Order matters in the file
- Global patterns should come first

### 2.3. Owner Specification

**Individual Users**

    # Username-based ownership
    /frontend/ @alice @bob
    /backend/ @charlie

**Teams**

    # Team-based ownership (recommended)
    /frontend/ @organization/frontend-team
    /backend/ @organization/backend-team

**Email Addresses**

    # For external reviewers (not recommended)
    /legal/ legal@company.com

## 3. Branch Protection Integration

### 3.1. Required Reviews from CODEOWNERS

1. Go to repository **"Settings"** â†’ **"Branches"**
2. Add or edit branch protection rule
3. Enable **"Require a pull request before merging"**
4. Check **"Require review from CODEOWNERS"**
5. Configure additional settings:
      - **Dismiss stale reviews** when new commits are pushed
      - **Require review from administrators**
      - **Allow specified actors to bypass**

### 3.2. Review Assignment Automation

**Automatic Assignment**

- GitHub automatically requests reviews from CODEOWNERS
- Assignment happens when PR is created
- Updates when files are added/removed
- Respects team and individual settings

**Load Balancing**

- Use teams for better distribution
- GitHub rotates assignments within teams
- Consider team size and availability
- Monitor review workload distribution

---

## 4. Advanced Automation

### 4.1. GitHub Actions Integration

**Auto-assign Based on Labels**

  ```yaml
  name: Auto-assign reviewers
  on:
    pull_request:
      types: [opened, labeled]

  jobs:
    assign-reviewers:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/github-script@v6
          with:
            script: |
              const { data: pr } = await github.rest.pulls.get({
                owner: context.repo.owner,
                repo: context.repo.repo,
                pull_number: context.issue.number
              });

              if (pr.labels.some(label => label.name === 'urgent')) {
                await github.rest.pulls.requestReviewers({
                  owner: context.repo.owner,
                  repo: context.repo.repo,
                  pull_number: context.issue.number,
                  reviewers: ['senior-dev1', 'senior-dev2']
                });
              }
  ```

### 4.2. Conditional CODEOWNERS

**Environment-Specific Owners**

    # Production-critical files need extra review
    /src/config/production.yml @organization/senior-team @organization/security-team

    # Development files can have relaxed ownership
    /src/config/development.yml @organization/backend-team

**Feature-Based Ownership**

    # Payment processing requires security review
    /src/payments/ @organization/backend-team @organization/security-team @organization/compliance-team

    # User interface changes need UX review
    /src/ui/ @organization/frontend-team @organization/ux-team

### 4.3. Dynamic Owner Assignment

**Context-Aware Assignment**

  ```yaml
  name: Dynamic CODEOWNERS
  on:
    pull_request:
      types: [opened]

  jobs:
    assign-owners:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Determine reviewers
          run: |
            # Custom logic to assign reviewers based on:
            # - Time of day
            # - Current workload
            # - Expertise areas
            # - Availability status
  ```

---

## 5. Collaboration Workflows

### 5.1. Cross-Team Review Process

**Multi-Team Coordination**

1. **Primary Review**: Domain expert team
2. **Secondary Review**: Cross-functional perspectives
3. **Final Approval**: Senior team member
4. **Security Review**: For sensitive changes

**Workflow Example**

    # Three-tier review for critical components
    /src/core/ @organization/core-team @organization/senior-team @organization/security-team

### 5.2. Escalation Procedures

**Review Escalation**

  - **24-hour rule**: Escalate if no response
  - **Weekend coverage**: Designated on-call reviewers
  - **Emergency changes**: Fast-track approval process
  - **Blocked PRs**: Automatic reassignment

**Automation for Escalation**

  ```yaml
  name: Review Escalation
  on:
    schedule:
      - cron: '0 9 * * *'  # Daily at 9 AM

  jobs:
    check-stale-reviews:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Find stale PRs
          run: |
            # Find PRs waiting for review > 24 hours
            # Reassign or escalate as needed
            # Notify team leads
  ```

### 5.3. Quality Gates

**Mandatory Checks**

- All CODEOWNERS must approve
- Automated tests must pass
- Security scans must complete
- Documentation must be updated

**Progressive Enhancement**

    # Junior developers need mentor review
    * @organization/junior-devs @organization/mentors

    # Senior developers can self-approve minor changes
    /docs/ @organization/senior-devs
