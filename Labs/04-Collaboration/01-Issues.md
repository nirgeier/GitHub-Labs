## 8. Automation and Integration

### 8.1. GitHub Actions for Issues

Create automated workflows for issue management:

    name: Issue Management
    on:
      issues:
        types: [opened, labeled]
    
    jobs:
      auto-assign:
        if: github.event.action == 'opened'
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/github-script@v6
            with:
              script: |
                github.rest.issues.addAssignees({
                  owner: context.repo.owner,
                  repo: context.repo.repo,
                  issue_number: context.issue.number,
                  assignees: ['maintainer-username']
                });
    ```
### 8.2. Issue Forms (Beta)

Use issue forms for structured input:
    ```yaml
    name: Bug Report
    description: File a bug report
    title: "[Bug]: "
    labels: ["bug", "triage"]
    body:
      - type: markdown
        attributes:
          value: |
            Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!
      - type: input
        id: contact
        attributes:
          label: Contact Details
          description: How can we get in touch with you if we need more info?
