## Best Practices for GitHub Web Interface

### Using the Web Editor Effectively

- Use for small changes and quick fixes
- Good for documentation updates
- Ideal for reviewing and suggesting changes
- Limited for complex code changes

### Branch Protection Integration

- The web interface shows all required status checks
- Displays merge conflicts clearly
- Shows required reviews status
- Integrates with branch protection rules

### Collaboration Features

- Use @mentions to notify team members
- Link to issues using #issue-number
- Use project boards integration
- Leverage milestone tracking

---

## Troubleshooting

### PR Not Appearing

1. **Check branch push**: Ensure your branch is pushed to the remote repository

   ```sh
   git push origin feature-branch-name
   ```

2. **Verify repository access**: Ensure you have proper permissions

### Cannot Create PR

1. **Permission issues**: Ensure you have write access to the repository
2. **No changes**: Verify your branch has commits different from the base branch
3. **Same branch**: Cannot create PR from a branch to itself

### Missing Compare Button

1. The "Compare & pull request" button only appears for recently pushed branches
2. Use the manual method: Pull requests tab â†’ New pull request
3. Ensure you're viewing the correct repository
